# This enables Google Drive integration, namely the per-puzzle spreadsheets.
# If you are running on Compute Engine, you don't need to set this, but you
# do need to request the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive scope for your
# VM. It's not one of the default scope choices, so while your vm is stopped,
# add it using `gcloud compute instances set-service-account $instance_name \
# --zone $zone_name --scopes default,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`
# You can do this from the cloud shell.
# If you aren't running on Compute Engine, or you want to log in as a regular
# user account, install gcloud and run `gcloud auth application-default login`.
# If you want to run as a service account, put the service account's
# credential json file somwhere 'nobody:nogroup' can read it and set this to
# that path. You will probably have to enable the Drive API in the project the
# service account comes from. If you want to protect the credential better than
# that, you can edit the user and group the app runs as in
# /etc/systemd/system/codex-batch.service, then run `systemctl daemon-reload`.

# Relevant public keys are:
# huntYear: It appears the same database can store multiple years; this
#           distinguishes them.
# defaultHost: Used to generate gravatars when an email address isn't specified.
# picker: a dict containing keys and IDs for the google drive upload functionality.
#         its keys are clientId, developerKey, and appId.
#         Get them at https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials.
#         These are distinct from the server-side keys you may find in
#         /etc/codex-batch.env.
